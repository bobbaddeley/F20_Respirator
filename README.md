# F20 Respirator
This is an attempt at PPE for COVID19 using a ResMed AirFit F20 mask as the base for a respirator. The design then uses the air port to mate an adapter that contains a filter.

## Assembly
The respirator is composed of the following components:
* 1 ResMed AirFit F20 mask. Others may fit; the funnel shape has an outer diameter of 31.5mm and is intended to press fit into this mask. Note that the elbow is not inserted.
* 1 Funnel piece (in this repository).
* 2 Grid pieces (in this repository, but a suitable alternative may be sourced elsewhere
* 1 Rubber band (for holding the assembly together)
* 1 piece of 3" x 3" N95 filter material. Masks are made of 6"x6" squares not including the seam, so a single mask can be trimmed into 4 squares.

To assemble, put one grill into the funnel, then place a piece of filter material on top of the grill. Place the second grill over the top of that. Use rubber bands to linked to the posts on the sides of the funnel to hold everything in place.

## Design Notes
The CPAP masks are intended for long use over many hours, and are made to be cleaned regularly. They must maintain a good seal with the wearer. This makes them particularly suitable for use as a respirator mask. By then attaching a filter, the wearer can stretch the use of their N95 mask significantly. The filter is 2.5"x2.5" because:
  1. Smaller than that makes it more difficult to breathe.
  2. Larger than that makes it impossible to get 4 filters from a single mask.
  3. 2.5" instead of 3" gives us some overlap at the edges and gives us some tolerance for poor cutting.
  
The design of the funnel is intended to be simple for injection molding, requiring a simple 2-part mold. A press fit into the port is thus easy to attain rather than special clips that grab the outer part of the port. While those clips would be better for long-term production, press fit may be adequate for the current needs. Having a grill be a second part is also quick to accomplish, and the grill is easy to 3D print or injection mold. The front and back grills are identical to reduce the number of unique parts. It may be necessary to adjust the grill to extend to the edges to better retain and seal the edges of the filter.
A rubber band over the front gives us ease of assembly as well as ease of replacing the filter and cleaning, and it eliminates any challenges with hinges or hooks or snaps that might be present in a more robust design.
